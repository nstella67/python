No Goodbyes

Maybe one day I can see you
 We can smile and wave
 And it'll be okay
 Maybe one day it'll be cool
 We could just be friends
 Without the complications that it brings
 When we start saying things
 Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
 Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
 And we tried hard just to fix it
 But we broke it more
 And so I guess some things are not meant to last
 Is it too much to ask

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 Just for tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh

 In a dark room
 We don't have to
 See the light of truth
 Between me and you
 We can stay blind
 In the meantime
 Let our bodies say
 What we can never seem to communicate
 Even though it's too late

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 Just for tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh
 No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes, eh

 Maybe one day I'll see you
 Just smile and wave and be okay

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 For tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh
