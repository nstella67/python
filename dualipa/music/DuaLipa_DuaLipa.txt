Be The One


I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

Blow Your Mind (Mwah)

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Breakdown]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

Garden

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
 Now we know what's deep inside
 Remember when we ran in the open?
 Now we know what's in the wild
 Used to think that this love was heaven sent
 How did we get lost, can't get back again
 Tell me, is the light on the outside?

 So are we leaving this garden of eden?
 Are we leaving this garden of eden?

 Used to walk around your apartment
 With nothing, but a smile on me
 But tonight I'm so self conscious
 Isn't it so clear to see
 Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
 Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
 When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

 So are we leaving this garden of eden?
 Are we leaving this garden of eden?
 Now I know what I know
 But it's hard to find the meaning
 Where do we go?
 'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
 I would die for you, would you do that for me?
 Tell the truth, what you wanna do
 Is it me and you? Are you with me, honey?
 I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
 I would die for you, would you do that for me?
 Tell the truth, what you wanna do
 Is it me and you? Are you with me?

 So are we leaving this garden of eden?
 Are we leaving this garden of eden?
 Now I know what I know
 But it's hard to find the meaning
 Where do we go?
 'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
 Now we know what's deep inside
 Remember when we ran in the open?

 So are we leaving?
 (Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
 Are we leaving?
 (Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
 Now I know what I know
 But it's hard to find the meaning
 Where do we go?
 'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
 (Eden, eden, eden…)

Homesick

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

Hotter Than Hell

Ah yeah
Ah yeah

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know I'm wanted
Can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

IDGAF

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (Get to me)
Get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

Kiss And Make Up

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Lost In Your Light (Feat. Miguel)

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
Let's get lost in the light, baby

Dua Lipa - New Rules

One one one

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
Too many times too many times
Oh he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love he doesn't love me
So I tell myself I tell myself

One don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him

I got new rules I count 'em
I got new rules I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn no way
Nowhere to turn no
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
I never learn I never learn
But my love he doesn't love me
So I tell myself I tell myself
I do I do I do

One don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him

I got new rules I count 'em
I got new rules I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
I got new rules I count 'em
Eat sleep and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I
I got new I got new I got new

One don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him you ain't getting over him

I got new rules I count 'em
I got new rules I count 'em
Oh whoa-oh
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules I count 'em
Baby you know I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in don't let him in
Don't don't don't don't
Don't be his friend don't be his friend
Don't don't don't don't
Don't let him in don't let him in
Don't don't don't don't
Don't be his friend don't be his friend
Don't don't don't don't
You gettin' over him

No Goodbyes

Maybe one day I can see you
 We can smile and wave
 And it'll be okay
 Maybe one day it'll be cool
 We could just be friends
 Without the complications that it brings
 When we start saying things
 Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
 Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
 And we tried hard just to fix it
 But we broke it more
 And so I guess some things are not meant to last
 Is it too much to ask

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 Just for tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh

 In a dark room
 We don't have to
 See the light of truth
 Between me and you
 We can stay blind
 In the meantime
 Let our bodies say
 What we can never seem to communicate
 Even though it's too late

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 Just for tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh
 No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes, eh

 Maybe one day I'll see you
 Just smile and wave and be okay

 For tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 For tonight
 Pretend that it's all alright
 (All alright)
 Why don't we hold each other
 Use each other, whisper pretty lies
 Just for tonight
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes
 (No goodbyes)
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes
 No goodbyes, eh

Room For 2

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Running

You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Been too many miles

When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?

Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Thinking 'Bout You

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Want To

"Want To"

I'm young for tonight
It's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch
I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

I won't stop
Not now, guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go-o-o in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

Some people do
But some they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mic, okay
Some need the light
And some people like the dark, okay, yeah

I won't stop
Not now, guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go-o-o in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don't judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight

I'll dance if I want to
My hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Body, body, and my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body
